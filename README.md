### the decisions of design taken.

**The choices made in designing the app aim to make it user-friendly and easy to navigate. For the login process, we keep things simple by using a single screen. Sign up is divided into three steps, each in a different part of the screen, making it easy to move through the process.**

**On the home page, we stick to one main screen but break down the functionality into four parts, each on its own screen and we make other navigation for this process. This setup makes it simple for users to switch between different things they want to do in the app.**

**Behind the scenes, we use a design pattern MVVM, which helps keep the code organized and easy to manage. For connecting to the internet and getting data, we use a tool called Retrofit. We've also set up our own server to provide the app with the information it needs. This way, we have more control over how the app works, making it faster and more tailored to what users need. Overall, these design choices are meant to create an app that's easy to use and works smoothly.**
